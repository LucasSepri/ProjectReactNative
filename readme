<!-- Console Error
ViewPropTypes will be removed from React Native,
along with all other PropTypes. We recommend that you migrate away from PropTypes and switch to a type system like TypeScript. If you need to continue using ViewPropTypes, migrate to the 'deprecated-react-native-prop-types' package. 

Solution:
npm install deprecated-react-native-prop-types
